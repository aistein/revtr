1) Now that we are classifying destinations only by BGP, DC and SC don't need to be run on ASN or S24 -- fix the pipeline to reflect this
2) For IC, compare ordering ingrs by num-meas to ordering ingrs by min-dist
3) Is it really true that for SC, the average delta is < 1?  This would mean SC is giving more hops than either DC or IC
4) Current multiprocessing Stage-1 takes 5 hours to run on the full set... if there is time, reconfigure to process 4 VPs at a time
